She develops reproducible and shareable pipelines for pathogen surveillance and genomic epidemiology, with experience in SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, HIV, and honey-bee viruses. When not coding for high-performance computing clusters, she enjoys exploring novel bioinformatics tools for genome assembly, annotation, and phylogenetic analyses."
